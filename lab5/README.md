Write a program using the POSIX API functions for file opening, file reading, file writing, and file closing to create a replica of the `cp` command. Name the program `mycp`. Based on the differences in `mycp` command arguments, implement the following two functionalities:
   (1) Copy a file to another file within the same directory.
   (2) Copy a file to a different directory.

Ensure that the program handles special cases and boundary conditions gracefully, such as:
   (1) When the destination file already exists, prompt the user with options like "overwrite" or "merge," and implement the functionality to either overwrite the destination file or merge it with the source file (by appending the source file content to the end of the destination file).
   (2) If the source file does not exist, display an error message.
   (3) If the source file is a directory, display an error message.
